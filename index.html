    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! Thank you for reading about me. My name is Spencer Dennis, I am 28 years old and I am trying to forge a career in the coding industry. I have always been interested in the tech/software industry from a young age, but recently I enrolled in a course through the program Epicodus to learn how to become a programmer. I will go into more detail about my interests, hobbies and skills below in my portfolio.</p>
